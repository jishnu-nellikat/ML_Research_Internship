The objective of this project is to contrast six different supervised ML algorithms to determine how efficacious they are at making correct identifications of PHAs.
The Kaggle dataset ‘NASA: Asteroids Classification’ has been used for this endeavour and the algorithms logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbour, balanced bagging, XGBoost, and support vector machine have been chosen for the same.
Accuracy scores, precision scores, recall scores, and F1 scores are the metrics that the algorithms in question have been evaluated over.
